        //1.	Create a string array that contains your five favorite movies. Then, use the console to display the second movie in your array.
        //var arrMovies = ["Harold & Maude","Kind Hearts and Coronets","The Royal Tenenbaums","Brief Encounter","Some Like it Hot"];
        //window.console.log(arrMovies[1]);
        
        //2.	Declare an array called movies. Then, assign one of your favorite movies to each index in the array until you have 5 total movies in your array. Then, use the console to display the first movie in your array.
        //var movies = [];
        //movies[0] = "Harold & Maude";
        //movies[1] = "Kind Hearts and Coronets";
        //movies[2] = "The Royal Tenenbaums";
        //movies[3] = "Brief Encounter";
        //movies[4] = "Some Like it Hot";
        //window.console.log(movies[0]);
        
        //3.	Add a new movie into the 3rd position within your array. Then, use the console to display the length of the array. You should now have 6 total movies stored in the array.
        //var arrMovies = ["Harold & Maude","Kind Hearts and Coronets","The Royal Tenenbaums","Brief Encounter","Some Like it Hot"];
        //arrMovies.splice(2,0,"Psycho");
        //window.console.log(arrMovies.length);
        
        //4.	Declare an array called movies. Then, assign one of your favorite movies to each index in the array until you have 5 total movies in your array. Now, use the delete operator to remove the first movie in the array. Use the console to display the contents of the array.
        //var movies = ["Harold & Maude","Kind Hearts and Coronets","The Royal Tenenbaums","Brief Encounter","Some Like it Hot"];
        //delete movies[0];
        //window.console.log(movies);
        
        //5.	Declare an array called movies. Then, assign one of your favorite movies to each index in the array until you have 7 total movies in your array. Now, use a for loop to iterate through the array and display each movie within the console window.
        //var movies = ["Harold & Maude","Kind Hearts and Coronets","The Royal Tenenbaums","Brief Encounter","Some Like it Hot","Psycho","Jurassic Park"];        
        //for (var i=0; i < movies.length; i++) {
        //    window.console.log(movies[i]);
        //}
        
        //6.	Now, use a for-in loop to iterate through the array and display each movie within the console window.
        //var movies = ["Harold & Maude","Kind Hearts and Coronets","The Royal Tenenbaums","Brief Encounter","Some Like it Hot","Psycho","Jurassic Park"];
        //for (var index in movies) {
        //    window.console.log(movies[index]);
        //}   
        
        //7.	Using the for-in loop to iterate through the array, display each movie within the console window in a sorted view.
        //var movies = ["Harold & Maude","Kind Hearts and Coronets","The Royal Tenenbaums","Brief Encounter","Some Like it Hot","Psycho","Jurassic Park"];
        //for (var index in movies) {
        //    movies.sort();
        //    window.console.log(movies[index]);
        //}          
        
        //8.	Under the previous movies array, create a new array called leastFavMovies. Populate the array with the 3 movies that you regret watching. Display both arrays within the console window so that it’s formatted to look like this (note the spacing, you must include that too):
        //Movies I like:
        //
        //Movie 1
        //Movie 2
        //Movie 3
        //…
        //
        //Movies I regret watching:
        //
        //Movie 1
        //Movie 2
        //Movie 3
        //var movies = ["Harold & Maude","Kind Hearts and Coronets","The Royal Tenenbaums","Brief Encounter","Some Like it Hot","Psycho","Jurassic Park"];
        //var leastFavMovies = ["Reign Over Me", "Liz & Dick","Spy Kidz"];
        //    window.console.log("Movies I like:\n\n");
        //    for (var index in movies){
        //    window.console.log(movies[index]);
        //}
        //    window.console.log("\nMovies I regret watching:\n\n");
        //    for (var index in leastFavMovies){
        //    window.console.log(leastFavMovies[index]);      
        //    }         

        //9.	Now, use the concat() method to merge the two arrays together into a single array called movies. Use the console window to display the list in reverse sorted order.
        //var bestMovies = ["Harold & Maude","Kind Hearts and Coronets","The Royal Tenenbaums","Brief Encounter","Some Like it Hot","Psycho","Jurassic Park"];
        //var leastFavMovies = ["Reign Over Me", "Liz & Dick","Spy Kidz"];  
        //var movies = bestMovies.concat(leastFavMovies).sort().reverse();
        //window.console.log(movies);
        
        //10.	Return just the last item in the array and display it within the console window.
        //var bestMovies = ["Harold & Maude","Kind Hearts and Coronets","The Royal Tenenbaums","Brief Encounter","Some Like it Hot","Psycho","Jurassic Park"];
        //var leastFavMovies = ["Reign Over Me", "Liz & Dick","Spy Kidz"];  
        //var movies = bestMovies.concat(leastFavMovies).sort().reverse();
        //var lastMovie = movies.pop();
        //window.console.log(lastMovie);
        
        //11.	Remove the previous method and this time return just the first item in the array and display it within the console window.
        //var bestMovies = ["Harold & Maude","Kind Hearts and Coronets","The Royal Tenenbaums","Brief Encounter","Some Like it Hot","Psycho","Jurassic Park"];
        //var leastFavMovies = ["Reign Over Me", "Liz & Dick","Spy Kidz"];  
        //var movies = bestMovies.concat(leastFavMovies).sort().reverse();
        //var firstMovie = movies.shift();
        //window.console.log(firstMovie);
        
        //12.	Programmatically retrieve the movies in your array that you do not like and return their indices. Then, using those indices, programmatically add movies that you do like. 
        //var bestMovies = ["Harold & Maude","Kind Hearts and Coronets","The Royal Tenenbaums","Brief Encounter","Some Like it Hot","Psycho","Jurassic Park"];
        //var leastFavMovies = ["Reign Over Me", "Liz & Dick","Spy Kidz"];  
        //var movies = bestMovies.concat(leastFavMovies);
        //window.console.log(movies.indexOf("Reign Over Me"));
        //window.console.log(movies.indexOf("Liz & Dick"));
        //window.console.log(movies.indexOf("Spy Kidz"));
        //movies.splice(7,3,"Midnight in Paris", "La Strada", "Cinema Paradiso");
        //window.console.log(movies);
        
        //13.	Create two associative arrays called employee1 and employee2 respectively. Each array should have an employeeid, name, title, department, and whether or not the employee is a current employee of the company. Now, add both of those associative arrays to a new array called employees. Then, programmatically display the name of the second employee within a console window. 
        //var employee1 = [];
        //employee1["employeeid"] = 12345;
        //employee1["name"] = "John Smith";
        //employee1["title"] = "Manager";
        //employee1["department"] = "Engineering";
        //employee1["currentemployee"] = true;
        //
        //var employee2 = [];
        //employee2["employeeid"] = 67890;
        //employee2["name"] = "Jane Doe";
        //employee2["title"] = "Associate";
        //employee2["department"] = "HR";
        //employee2["currentemployee"] = false;
        //
        //var employees = [employee1, employee2];        
        //window.console.log(employees[1]["name"]);        
        
        //14.	Using the above code, modify the code slightly so that you’re using a loop to loop through the array and printing out the names of both employees.
        //var employee1 = [];
        //employee1["employeeid"] = 12345;
        //employee1["name"] = "John Smith";
        //employee1["title"] = "Manager";
        //employee1["department"] = "Engineering";
        //employee1["currentemployee"] = true;
        //
        //var employee2 = [];
        //employee2["employeeid"] = 67890;
        //employee2["name"] = "Jane Doe";
        //employee2["title"] = "Associate";
        //employee2["department"] = "HR";
        //employee2["currentemployee"] = false;
        //
        //var employees = [employee1, employee2];
        //
        //for (i=0; i < employees.length; i++) {
        //    window.console.log(employees[i]["name"]);
        //}  
        
        //15.	And to really tick you off, add a third employee and set his employment status to false. Then, programmatically loop through the array but don’t display an employee if they aren’t a current employee of the company. Basically, only the first two should appear in the console window.
        //var employee1 = [];
        //employee1["employeeid"] = 12345;
        //employee1["name"] = "John Smith";
        //employee1["title"] = "Manager";
        //employee1["department"] = "Engineering";
        //employee1["currentemployee"] = true;
        //
        //var employee2 = [];
        //employee2["employeeid"] = 67890;
        //employee2["name"] = "Jane Doe";
        //employee2["title"] = "Associate";
        //employee2["department"] = "HR";
        //employee2["currentemployee"] = true;
        //        
        //var employee3 = [];
        //employee3["employeeid"] = 54321;
        //employee3["name"] = "Jack Ripper";
        //employee3["title"] = "Detective";
        //employee3["department"] = "Defense";
        //employee3["currentemployee"] = false;
        //
        //var employees = [employee1, employee2, employee3];
        //
        //for (i=0; i < employees.length; i++) {
        //    if (employees[i]["currentemployee"] == true) {
        //    window.console.log(employees[i]["name"]);
        //    }
        //}        
        
        //16.	Create a multi-dimensional array that contains your 5 favorite movies and their ranking from 1-5. The array should look something like this: 
        //movies = [["Movie 1", 1], ["Movie 2", 2], ["Movie 3", 3], ["Movie 4", 4], ["Movie 5", 5]];
        //Now, loop through the array and filter out and display only the movie names. You must use the filter() method and you’ll need to filter out the names by their primitive data type.
        //var movies = [["Harold & Maude", 1], ["The Royal Tenenbaums", 2], ["Midnight in Paris", 3], ["Kind Hearts and Coronets", 4], ["Psycho", 5]];
        //for (i=0; i < movies.length; i++) {
        //    var movieNames = movies[i].filter(function(item) { 
        //        return typeof item == "string";
        //    });
        //    window.console.log(movieNames);
        //}
